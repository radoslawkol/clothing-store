# Clothing Store Ecommerce site

## Story
I wanted to create an ecommerce website. I knew that it will be a challenge for me, but also an important experience.
Also, the purpose of this project was to get familiar with Next.js. I think this project enhanced my programming and solving problems skills.
I am aware that code might not be everywhere perfect and there are things to improve, but this project was quite complicated, because I tried a lot of new technologies and I spent some time to create an idea how this website will look and work. It took me a long period of time to complete this, because of school and problems I encountered. Now I am much more aware how ecommerce sites work, but there is still some things to learn.

## Encountered problems
1. Using only product's id
I wasn't aware how ecommerce system should be like. Firstly, I based on products' ids, which wasn't great, because e.g in shopping cart product could have the same id, but different size chose by user and color, so I had to introduced SKU numbers to make each cart product unique. I read about SKU on the Inthernet and I applied this to every product. SKU is unique for the same products, but with different color or size. I realised how important is a knowledge about what you want to build. In future I will plan app more carefully and do more reaserch to not change logic so many times.
